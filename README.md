# Learning-ThreeJS

- The goal of this repo is to follow the course from https://threejs-journey.com
- You might ask what is threejs ? Here you go: https://threejs.org/
- I wrote this ReadMe at the end of lesson 5 and this is the current progress ðŸ¦˜:

## Progress

## Day 11
- Today I learned about importing 3D models in ThreeJS. Never heard of it before, but apparently .gltf is commonly used.
- Also made one of my two objects use their animations. The result was a running fox.

## Day 10
- Today felt so awarding. I learned how to integrate ThreeJS into a common HTML website in the background and the result was stunning.
- Also learned today about physics, which open up many more possibilites. I used cannonjs today, but ammojs is also popular

## Day 9
- Today I made an entire galaxy only made out of particles, which I learned about yesterday.
- Also learned about raycasts, which are usefull by themself, but also important for registering mouse events like hover/click.

## Day 6

- Today I learned about lights and shadows. Some of them provider helpers which can be useful to visualize where the light is going.
- Also created a performant nice fake shadow by shadow-baking my texture.

## Day 5

- Today I made a deep dive into different kind of materials
- Converted a font to typeface and used it to create a 3D Text

### Day 4

- Today I learned about debugging with lil-gui which will be very useful in the future, when I need to try different values out
- Imported my first textures! Used a diamond block because it fit so well haha
- Created my own geometry, only by providing an array of numbers, amazing isn't it ?

### Day 3

- Have only completed one lesson today because I was trying to setup a pipeline for this project
- It worked and my current results can be seen here: https://lucas-goldner.github.io/Learning-ThreeJS/
- Anyway today I learned about adjusting the canvas to fullscreen in order to create a more immersive experience

### Day 2

- Today I learned about animating my object and controlling my camera with controls
